**Safety Tips:**
Even with an elite, undetected tool, smart habits ensure your long-term safety.

  * **Disable VPN:** Some anti-cheat systems can flag VPN usage, causing false positives. Turn it off when gaming for optimal security.
  * **Temporarily Disable Antivirus:** Your antivirus might mistakenly quarantine our tool. Whitelist the specific folder or temporarily disable it during use.
  * **Keep Game Client Updated:** Always ensure your Rust game client is fully updated before launching the wallhack. This ensures compatibility and reduces detection risk.
  * **Run as Administrator:** Launch `RustLoader.exe` with administrator privileges for seamless injection and full functionality.
  * **Whitelist Installation Folder:** Add the tool's directory to your antivirus exceptions to prevent accidental deletion or interference.
  * **Blend In:** While the software is covert, your *behavior* isn't. Avoid unnatural actions like constantly looking at players through multiple walls, perfectly pre-firing unseen enemies, or pathing directly to hidden stashes. Play smart and make your intel look like intuition\!
  * **Leverage HWID Spoofing:** If you‚Äôve faced bans before, utilize our integrated or recommended hardware ID spoofing features to prevent residual hardware flags on new accounts.
  * **Choose Your Squad Wisely:** Be mindful of who you play with. Associating with known cheaters can sometimes lead to guilt-by-association bans on some community servers.
